#lolbuddy
a cli tool to update league of legends itemsets and ability order from champion.gg

#Installation:

open Terminal
* ```git clone https://github.com/CyrusRoshan/lolbuddy.git```

#Usage:

First get a champion.gg API key from TSM at <a href="http://api.champion.gg">api.champion.gg</a>, then:

Use ```lolbuddy``` to start lolbuddy and automatically fetch and create the item sets, which will be named "Champion.gg".

If no API key or league installation location have been entered, or they are invalid, you will be prompted for the API key, and lolbuddy will check the default league location for your OS. If it is not found, you will be prompted for that as well.
